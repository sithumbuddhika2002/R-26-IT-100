# 🌱 LunuNeth AI - Precision Agriculture Platform for Onion Crop Health

LunuNeth AI is an integrated, mobile-first AI diagnostic framework specifically built for Sri Lankan onion farmers. The system provides real-time, microclimate-aware diagnostic capabilities to detect and manage diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. It empowers local farmers by directly connecting complex Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and TinyML Computer Vision models through a conversational, trilingual chatbot (Sinhala, English, Singlish).

This research project consists of four deeply integrated AI sub-systems covering NLP, Object Detection, Semantic Image Classification, and Spatio-Temporal Graph-based inference.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Core Components

This platform acts as a unified Flutter mobile application powered by four distinct, state-of-the-art intelligent systems running through a centralized backend routing layer:

### 1️⃣ Component 1: Purple Blotch Disease Detection
**Developed by: IT22054890**
- **Objective:** Mobile-optimized, AI-based detection and severity classification of the *Alternaria porri* fungal pathogen (Purple Blotch).
- **Core Technology:** Lightweight CNNs (EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3) and Vision Transformers (ViT-Small) deployed via TinyML (TensorFlow Lite, INT8 Quantization).
- **Features:** 4-level severity grading (Healthy, Early, Mid, Severe), quantitative stress scoring (0–100%), Grad-CAM explainability for lesion highlighting, and AutoML-driven architecture optimization.

### 2️⃣ Component 2: Thrips Pest Detection
**Developed by: IT22226464**
- **Objective:** Small-object detection to localize and quantify *Thysanoptera* (Thrips) infestations in field images.
- **Core Technology:** YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN optimized for small objects via anchor box tuning, focal loss, and Sliced Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI).
- **Features:** Pest bounding box localization, infestation severity heatmaps (Low/Medium/High), TinyML edge deployment (<10MB models), and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) threshold-based action recommendations.

### 3️⃣ Component 3: Trilingual Chatbot & Context-Aware Diagnostics
**Developed by: IT22087256**
- **Objective:** A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ST-GNN) that fuses text symptoms, geolocation, and temporal weather arrays to output dynamic agricultural advice in Sinhala, Singlish, or English.
- **Core Technology:** Fine-tuned mBERT for symptom embedding, OpenWeatherMap API for temporal features, Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE/GAT), and Generative Seq2Seq models.
- **Features:** Replaces simple keyword matching with robust graph-based Bayesian reasoning. The system integrates confidence scores from the visual models as "nodes" in the graph to conduct multi-turn conversational differential diagnosis. 

### 4️⃣ Component 4: Nutrient Deficiency Detection
**Developed by: IT22142528**
- **Objective:** Image-based classification and regression model to identify Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Magnesium, and Calcium deficiencies.
- **Core Technology:** Feature fusion combining CNN deep features (MobileNetV3) with engineered color (RGB/HSV) and texture (GLCM) indices.
- **Features:** Lab-free N/P/K stress scores mapping to smallholder-calibrated fertilizer prescriptions. Incorporates SHAP and Grad-CAM for predicting and explaining localized leaf discoloration independently from disease damage.

## 🌍 Impact and Commercialization

Sri Lanka imports approximately 200,000 metric tons of onions annually due to significant production shortfalls. Pests, diseases, and improper nutrient distribution can strip up to 40% of crop yields.

LunuNeth addresses exactly this gap by:
- Offering lab-free detection directly on mid-range smartphones offline.
- Supplying quantitative, locally validated advice backed by the Field Crops Research and Development Institute (FCRDI).
- Supporting native code-switching dialogue (Sinhala + English), meaning farmers interact with the AI exactly how they speak every day.
- Unifying separate ML predictions under a contextual micro-climate framework (linking weather, crop location, and observed symptoms into a cohesive diagnostic).
